A modern AI powered code scratchpad for Typescript. Written in Domeleon, with plenty of Domeleon examples. The samples were all written by LLMs which code quickly with the predictable, straightforward Domeleon design. This isn't an accident; it's how Domeleon was created - all usability testing was done by getting LLMs to write Domeleon code.
